xxbos   this   is   a   xxunk   xxunk   film .   the   acting ,   script   and   xxunk   are   all   xxunk .   the   music   is   good ,   too ,   though   it   is   mostly   early   in   the   film ,   when   things   are   still   xxunk   xxunk .   there   are   no   really   superstars   in   the   cast ,   though   several   faces   will   be   xxunk .   the   entire   cast   does   an   excellent   job   with   the   script .

   but   it   is   hard   to   watch ,   because   there   is   no   good   end   to   a   situation   like   the   one   presented .   it   is   now   xxunk   to   xxunk   the   british   for   setting   xxunk   and   xxunk   against   each   other ,   and   then   xxunk   xxunk   them   into   two   countries .   there   is   some   merit   in   this   view ,   but   it &#39; s   also   true   that   no   one   forced   xxunk   and   xxunk   in   the   region   to   xxunk   each   other   as   they   did   around   the   time   of   partition .   it   xxunk   more   xxunk   that   the   british   simply   saw   the   xxunk   between   the   xxunk   and   were   xxunk   enough   to   xxunk   them   to   their   own   ends .

   the   result   is   that   there   is   much   xxunk   and   xxunk   in   the   situation   and   this   is   very   xxunk   to   remember   and   to   see   on   the   screen .   but   it   is   never   painted   as   a   xxunk   case .   there   is   xxunk   and   xxunk   on   both   sides ,   and   also   the   hope   for   change   in   the   younger   generation .

   there   is   redemption   of   a   sort ,   in   the   end ,   when   xxunk   has   to   make   a   hard   choice   between   a   man   who   has   xxunk   her   life ,   but   also   truly   loved   her ,   and   her   family   which   has   xxunk   her ,   then   later   come   looking   for   her .   but   by   that   point ,   she   has   no   option   that   is   without   great   pain   for   her .

   this   film   carries   the   message   that   both   xxunk   and   xxunk   have   their   grave   xxunk ,   and   also   that   both   can   be   xxunk   and   xxunk   people .   the   reality   of   partition   makes   that   xxunk   all   the   more   xxunk ,   since   there   can   never   be   real   xxunk   across   the   india   /   pakistan   border .   in   that   sense ,   it   is   similar   to   &#34; mr   &amp;   mrs   xxunk &#34;.

   in   the   end ,   we   were   glad   to   have   seen   the   film ,   even   though   the   resolution   was   xxunk .   if   the   uk   and   us   could   deal   with   their   own   xxunk   of   xxunk   with   this   kind   of   xxunk ,   they   would   xxunk   be   better   off .,xxbos   every   once   in   a   long   while   a   movie   will   come   along   that   will   be   so   xxunk   that   i   feel   xxunk   to   xxunk   people .   if   i   labor   all   my   days   and   i   can   save   but   one   soul   from   xxunk   this   movie ,   how   great   will   be   my   joy .

   where   to   begin   my   xxunk   of   pain .   for   xxunk ,   there   was   a   musical   xxunk   every   five   minutes .   there   was   no   character   development .   every   character   was   a   stereotype .   we   had   xxunk   guy ,   fat   guy   who   xxunk   xxunk ,   xxunk   foreign   guy ,   etc .   the   script   xxunk   as   if   it   were   being   written   as   the   movie   was   being   shot .   the   production   value   was   so   xxunk   low   that   it   xxunk   like   i   was   xxunk   a   junior   high   video   presentation .   have   the   directors ,   producers ,   etc .   ever   even   seen   a   movie   before ?   xxunk   is   getting   worse   and   worse   with   every   new   entry .   the   concept   for   this   movie   xxunk   so   funny .   how   could   you   go   wrong   with   gary   coleman   and   a   xxunk   of   xxunk   xxunk   actors .   but   trust   me   when   i   say   this ,   things   went   wrong ,   very   wrong .,xxbos   name   just   says   it   all .   i   xxunk   this   movie   with   my   dad   when   it   came   out   and   having   xxunk   in   korea   he   had   great   xxunk   for   the   man .   the   xxunk   thing   about   this   film   is   that   it   only   xxunk   on   a   short   period   of   the   man &#39; s   life   -   xxunk   enough   the   man &#39; s   entire   life   would   have   made   such   an   epic   xxunk   that   it   is   xxunk   to   imagine   the   cost   for   production .

   some   xxunk   xxunk   to   the   xxunk   xxunk   about   the   man ,   which   are   cheap   xxunk .   the   theme   of   the   movie   &#34; duty ,   honor ,   country &#34;   are   not   just   xxunk   words   xxunk   from   the   lips   of   a   xxunk   officer   -   it   is   the   deep   declaration   of   one   man &#39; s   total   xxunk   to   his   country .

   xxunk   peck   being   the   liberal   that   he   was   xxunk   a   better   understanding   of   the   man .   he   does   a   great   job   xxunk   the   fearless   general   xxunk   with   the   humane   side   of   the   man .,xxbos   this   movie   xxunk   at   being   one   of   the   most   unique   movies   you &#39; ve   seen .   however   this   comes   from   the   fact   that   you   can &#39; t   make   heads   or   tails   of   this   mess .   it   almost   xxunk   as   a   series   of   challenges   set   up   to   xxunk   xxunk   or   not   you   are   xxunk   to   walk   out   of   the   movie   and   give   up   the   money   you   just   paid .   if   you   don &#39; t   want   to   feel   xxunk   you &#39; ll   sit   through   this   xxunk   film   and   xxunk   a   real   sense   of   xxunk   for   the   actors   xxunk ,   they &#39; ve   all   seen   better   days ,   but   then   you   xxunk   they   xxunk   got   paid   xxunk   a   bit   of   money   to   do   this   and   you &#39; ll   lose   xxunk   for   them   just   like   you &#39; ve   xxunk   done   for   the   film .   i   can &#39; t   go   on   enough   about   this   xxunk   movie ,   its   almost   something   that   ed   wood   would   have   made   and   in   that   case   it   xxunk   would   have   been   his   xxunk .

   to   start   you   are   forced   to   sit   through   an   opening   dialogue   the   xxunk   of   which   you &#39; ve   never   seen   /   heard ,   this   thing   has   got   to   be   five   minutes   long .   on   top   of   that   it   is   xxunk ,   as   to   xxunk   that   you   the   viewer   cannot   read .   then   we   meet   mr .   xxunk   and   the   xxunk   of   xxunk   lines   gets   xxunk ,   it   is   as   if   he   is   operating   xxunk   to   get   lines   on   to   the   movie   xxunk   tag   line .   soon   we   meet   stephen   xxunk ,   who   i   xxunk   xxunk )   and   he   does   his   best   not   to   xxunk   in   this   but   xxunk   he   does .   then   comes   the   ultimate   xxunk ,   tara   reid   playing   an   intelligent   role ,   oh   help   us !   tara   reid   is   not   a   very   talented   actress   and   xxunk   she   xxunk   gets   xxunk   in   movies ,   in   my   xxunk   though   she   should   stick   to   movies   of   the   american   pie   type .

   all   in   all   you   just   may   want   to   see   this   for   yourself   when   it   comes   out   on   video ,   i   know   that   i   got   a   kick   out   of   it ,   i   mean   xxunk   all   be   xxunk   here ,   xxunk   its   xxunk   to   xxunk   in   the   xxunk   of   others .,xxbos   from   the   start ,   you   know   how   this   movie   will   end .   it &#39; s   so   full   of   clich √© s   your   typical   xxunk   member   will   not   even   like   this   movie .   i   give   it   2   out   of   10,   only   because   of   the   acting   of   william   benton .   i   can &#39; t   believe   people   xxunk   6 +   for   this   movie .   it &#39; s   so   biased   towards   a   &#39; certain   point   of   view &#39;   ( once   a   thief xxunk   people   xxunk &#39; t   born   bad .   neither   are   they   born   good .   they   are   born   with   a   clean   slate .   it &#39; s   society ,   parents   and   education   what   makes   them   who   they   are .   and   if   they   take   the   wrong   turn ,   somewhere   down   the   line ,   it   xxunk   isn &#39; t   going   to   be   the   american   xxunk   system   that   gets   them   back   on   track !   xxunk ,   xxunk   this   movie   like   the   xxunk .   i   bet   you   have   better   things   to   do   with   your   time   than   waste   it   on   this   piece   of   xxunk .

xxbos   xxunk   was   a   show   i   xxunk   up   with .   from   late   night   xxunk   with   penn   and   teller   to   the   one ,   the   only ,   joe   bob   xxunk .   the   show   xxunk   me   up   friday   nights   back   in   my   high   school   years ,   and   provided   some   of   the   best   xxunk   memories   to   ever   come   outside   of   the   xxunk .

   without   a   doubt ,   the   best   late   night   television   ever .   if   you   didn &#39; t   stay   up ,   you   were   missing   out .

   i   know   john   bloom   and   joe   bob   live   on ,   but   i   want   them   back   where   they   belong xxunk xxunk !   question xxunk did   anyone   else   sit   through   all   4   hours   of   &#34; the   xxunk &#34;   ?   q :)

   long   live   xxunk !,xxbos   the   xxunk   between   the   characters   is   a   moral   disaster .   you   end   up   xxunk   most   of   the   characters   and   you   don &#39; t   xxunk   like   any   of   them .

   even   the   two   main   characters   played   by   david   and   xxunk   are   so   xxunk   written   that   you   really   don &#39; t   care   one   bit   about   them .   the   movie   has   no   plot ,   no   direction   and   no   purpose .   the   single   xxunk   quality   of   the   movie   was   to   treat   it   as   a   xxunk   into   the   xxunk   up   lives   of   a   few   xxunk   -   and   that &#39; s   xxunk   xxunk   even   as   an   afternoon   waste .,xxbos   for   a   low   budget   project ,   the   film   was   a   success .   the   story   is   xxunk ,   and   the   actors   were   xxunk .   eva   xxunk ,   who   now   stars   on   the   tv   show   &#34; xxunk ,&#34;   is   xxunk   than   ever .   the   xxunk   were   ideal   for   the   xxunk   plot ,   and   the   director   shows   his   talent   by   taking   on   many   xxunk   for   his   project .   of   course   this   low   budget   film   could   use   better   editing   xxunk   and   more   special   effects   for   the   gun   scenes ,   but   the   music   xxunk   this   script   moving .   although   this   film   has   it &#39; s   share   of   problems ,   such   as   xxunk ,   i   must   say   that   i   would   rent   the   director &#39; s   next   movie .   if   your   a   film   student ,   you   could   learn   a   few   things   from   the   director &#39; s   xxunk .,xxbos   yes ,   he   is !   xxunk no ,   not   because   of   xxunk   xxunk   to   xxunk   his   actors   and   show   xxunk   their   xxunk .   xxunk   is   the   naked   &#34; emperor &#34;   -   so   to   speak xxunk

   it &#39; s   big   time   for   someone   to   state   the   truth .   this   xxunk   is   a   xxunk ,   a   xxunk   xxunk   in   an   old   man &#39; s   body .   his   xxunk   of   nude   scenes   have   no   artistic   xxunk   xxunk .   it   is   100 %   visual   xxunk :   he   gets   his   kicks   by   making   the   actors   strip   in   the   xxunk   and   look   at   their   xxunk .   and   if   he   does   this   in   front   of   the   audience ,   he   might   eve   get   a   xxunk !   did   you   know   that ,   on   the   set   of   &#34; xxunk   xxunk &#34;,   he   used   to   xxunk   poor   xxunk   xxunk ,   by   xxunk   her :   &#34; oh ,   xxunk ,   how   i   wanna   f xxunk   you xxunk   she   is   a   great   lady ,   very   xxunk   and   sensitive ,   and   she   became   xxunk   xxunk   -   to   his   petty   satisfaction !   and ,   as   a   xxunk   alarm   signal   about   the   degree   of   xxunk   and   xxunk   of   education   in   xxunk   xxunk ,   so   many   people   are   still   so   xxunk   to   xxunk   these   visual   xxunk   &#34; works   of   art &#34;!   will   anyone   have   ever   the   xxunk   to   xxunk   the   truth   of   it   all ?,xxbos   an   excellent   film   xxunk   the   cross   xxunk   in   the   lives   of   a   xxunk   mix   of   not   so   ordinary   people   in   the   rural   pacific   northwest .   solid   xxunk   and   writing   along   with   fine   acting ,   xxunk   the   performances   by   xxunk   xxunk   and   dan   xxunk .   xxunk ,   this   film   was   made   in   the   same   year   as   the   highly   successful   &#34; crash ,&#34;   written   and   directed   by   paul   xxunk .   the   pace   of   the   action   may   not   be   as   xxunk   as   that   in   urban   los   angeles ,   and   the   characters   may   xxunk   to   be   better   xxunk   with   each   other   in   &#34; apart   from   that ,&#34;   but   the   personal   relationships   of   the   characters   are   as   xxunk   and   xxunk   and   their   stories   as   xxunk   as   any   of   those   in   &#34; crash .&#34;   for   those   xxunk   who   xxunk   &#34; crash &#34;   this   is   a   must   see   film .   also ,   xxunk   of   jim   xxunk   and   john   xxunk   will   like   this   movie .

xxbos   this   is   a   xxunk   xxunk   film .   the   acting ,   script   and   xxunk   are   all   xxunk .   the   music   is   good ,   too ,   though   it   is   mostly   early   in   the   film ,   when   things   are   still   xxunk   xxunk .   there   are   no   really   superstars   in   the   cast ,   though   several   faces   will   be   xxunk .   the   entire   cast   does   an   excellent   job   with   the   script .

   but   it   is   hard   to   watch ,   because   there   is   no   good   end   to   a   situation   like   the   one   presented .   it   is   now   xxunk   to   xxunk   the   british   for   setting   xxunk   and   xxunk   against   each   other ,   and   then   xxunk   xxunk   them   into   two   countries .   there   is   some   merit   in   this   view ,   but   it &#39; s   also   true   that   no   one   forced   xxunk   and   xxunk   in   the   region   to   xxunk   each   other   as   they   did   around   the   time   of   partition .   it   xxunk   more   xxunk   that   the   british   simply   saw   the   xxunk   between   the   xxunk   and   were   xxunk   enough   to   xxunk   them   to   their   own   ends .

   the   result   is   that   there   is   much   xxunk   and   xxunk   in   the   situation   and   this   is   very   xxunk   to   remember   and   to   see   on   the   screen .   but   it   is   never   painted   as   a   xxunk   case .   there   is   xxunk   and   xxunk   on   both   sides ,   and   also   the   hope   for   change   in   the   younger   generation .

   there   is   redemption   of   a   sort ,   in   the   end ,   when   xxunk   has   to   make   a   hard   choice   between   a   man   who   has   xxunk   her   life ,   but   also   truly   loved   her ,   and   her   family   which   has   xxunk   her ,   then   later   come   looking   for   her .   but   by   that   point ,   she   has   no   option   that   is   without   great   pain   for   her .

   this   film   carries   the   message   that   both   xxunk   and   xxunk   have   their   grave   xxunk ,   and   also   that   both   can   be   xxunk   and   xxunk   people .   the   reality   of   partition   makes   that   xxunk   all   the   more   xxunk ,   since   there   can   never   be   real   xxunk   across   the   india   /   pakistan   border .   in   that   sense ,   it   is   similar   to   &#34; mr   &amp;   mrs   xxunk &#34;.

   in   the   end ,   we   were   glad   to   have   seen   the   film ,   even   though   the   resolution   was   xxunk .   if   the   uk   and   us   could   deal   with   their   own   xxunk   of   xxunk   with   this   kind   of   xxunk ,   they   would   xxunk   be   better   off .,xxbos   every   once   in   a   long   while   a   movie   will   come   along   that   will   be   so   xxunk   that   i   feel   xxunk   to   xxunk   people .   if   i   labor   all   my   days   and   i   can   save   but   one   soul   from   xxunk   this   movie ,   how   great   will   be   my   joy .

   where   to   begin   my   xxunk   of   pain .   for   xxunk ,   there   was   a   musical   xxunk   every   five   minutes .   there   was   no   character   development .   every   character   was   a   stereotype .   we   had   xxunk   guy ,   fat   guy   who   xxunk   xxunk ,   xxunk   foreign   guy ,   etc .   the   script   xxunk   as   if   it   were   being   written   as   the   movie   was   being   shot .   the   production   value   was   so   xxunk   low   that   it   xxunk   like   i   was   xxunk   a   junior   high   video   presentation .   have   the   directors ,   producers ,   etc .   ever   even   seen   a   movie   before ?   xxunk   is   getting   worse   and   worse   with   every   new   entry .   the   concept   for   this   movie   xxunk   so   funny .   how   could   you   go   wrong   with   gary   coleman   and   a   xxunk   of   xxunk   xxunk   actors .   but   trust   me   when   i   say   this ,   things   went   wrong ,   very   wrong .,xxbos   name   just   says   it   all .   i   xxunk   this   movie   with   my   dad   when   it   came   out   and   having   xxunk   in   korea   he   had   great   xxunk   for   the   man .   the   xxunk   thing   about   this   film   is   that   it   only   xxunk   on   a   short   period   of   the   man &#39; s   life   -   xxunk   enough   the   man &#39; s   entire   life   would   have   made   such   an   epic   xxunk   that   it   is   xxunk   to   imagine   the   cost   for   production .

   some   xxunk   xxunk   to   the   xxunk   xxunk   about   the   man ,   which   are   cheap   xxunk .   the   theme   of   the   movie   &#34; duty ,   honor ,   country &#34;   are   not   just   xxunk   words   xxunk   from   the   lips   of   a   xxunk   officer   -   it   is   the   deep   declaration   of   one   man &#39; s   total   xxunk   to   his   country .

   xxunk   peck   being   the   liberal   that   he   was   xxunk   a   better   understanding   of   the   man .   he   does   a   great   job   xxunk   the   fearless   general   xxunk   with   the   humane   side   of   the   man .,xxbos   this   movie   xxunk   at   being   one   of   the   most   unique   movies   you &#39; ve   seen .   however   this   comes   from   the   fact   that   you   can &#39; t   make   heads   or   tails   of   this   mess .   it   almost   xxunk   as   a   series   of   challenges   set   up   to   xxunk   xxunk   or   not   you   are   xxunk   to   walk   out   of   the   movie   and   give   up   the   money   you   just   paid .   if   you   don &#39; t   want   to   feel   xxunk   you &#39; ll   sit   through   this   xxunk   film   and   xxunk   a   real   sense   of   xxunk   for   the   actors   xxunk ,   they &#39; ve   all   seen   better   days ,   but   then   you   xxunk   they   xxunk   got   paid   xxunk   a   bit   of   money   to   do   this   and   you &#39; ll   lose   xxunk   for   them   just   like   you &#39; ve   xxunk   done   for   the   film .   i   can &#39; t   go   on   enough   about   this   xxunk   movie ,   its   almost   something   that   ed   wood   would   have   made   and   in   that   case   it   xxunk   would   have   been   his   xxunk .

   to   start   you   are   forced   to   sit   through   an   opening   dialogue   the   xxunk   of   which   you &#39; ve   never   seen   /   heard ,   this   thing   has   got   to   be   five   minutes   long .   on   top   of   that   it   is   xxunk ,   as   to   xxunk   that   you   the   viewer   cannot   read .   then   we   meet   mr .   xxunk   and   the   xxunk   of   xxunk   lines   gets   xxunk ,   it   is   as   if   he   is   operating   xxunk   to   get   lines   on   to   the   movie   xxunk   tag   line .   soon   we   meet   stephen   xxunk ,   who   i   xxunk   xxunk )   and   he   does   his   best   not   to   xxunk   in   this   but   xxunk   he   does .   then   comes   the   ultimate   xxunk ,   tara   reid   playing   an   intelligent   role ,   oh   help   us !   tara   reid   is   not   a   very   talented   actress   and   xxunk   she   xxunk   gets   xxunk   in   movies ,   in   my   xxunk   though   she   should   stick   to   movies   of   the   american   pie   type .

   all   in   all   you   just   may   want   to   see   this   for   yourself   when   it   comes   out   on   video ,   i   know   that   i   got   a   kick   out   of   it ,   i   mean   xxunk   all   be   xxunk   here ,   xxunk   its   xxunk   to   xxunk   in   the   xxunk   of   others .,xxbos   from   the   start ,   you   know   how   this   movie   will   end .   it &#39; s   so   full   of   clich √© s   your   typical   xxunk   member   will   not   even   like   this   movie .   i   give   it   2   out   of   10,   only   because   of   the   acting   of   william   benton .   i   can &#39; t   believe   people   xxunk   6 +   for   this   movie .   it &#39; s   so   biased   towards   a   &#39; certain   point   of   view &#39;   ( once   a   thief xxunk   people   xxunk &#39; t   born   bad .   neither   are   they   born   good .   they   are   born   with   a   clean   slate .   it &#39; s   society ,   parents   and   education   what   makes   them   who   they   are .   and   if   they   take   the   wrong   turn ,   somewhere   down   the   line ,   it   xxunk   isn &#39; t   going   to   be   the   american   xxunk   system   that   gets   them   back   on   track !   xxunk ,   xxunk   this   movie   like   the   xxunk .   i   bet   you   have   better   things   to   do   with   your   time   than   waste   it   on   this   piece   of   xxunk .

xxbos   xxunk   was   a   show   i   xxunk   up   with .   from   late   night   xxunk   with   penn   and   teller   to   the   one ,   the   only ,   joe   bob   xxunk .   the   show   xxunk   me   up   friday   nights   back   in   my   high   school   years ,   and   provided   some   of   the   best   xxunk   memories   to   ever   come   outside   of   the   xxunk .

   without   a   doubt ,   the   best   late   night   television   ever .   if   you   didn &#39; t   stay   up ,   you   were   missing   out .

   i   know   john   bloom   and   joe   bob   live   on ,   but   i   want   them   back   where   they   belong xxunk xxunk !   question xxunk did   anyone   else   sit   through   all   4   hours   of   &#34; the   xxunk &#34;   ?   q :)

   long   live   xxunk !,xxbos   the   xxunk   between   the   characters   is   a   moral   disaster .   you   end   up   xxunk   most   of   the   characters   and   you   don &#39; t   xxunk   like   any   of   them .

   even   the   two   main   characters   played   by   david   and   xxunk   are   so   xxunk   written   that   you   really   don &#39; t   care   one   bit   about   them .   the   movie   has   no   plot ,   no   direction   and   no   purpose .   the   single   xxunk   quality   of   the   movie   was   to   treat   it   as   a   xxunk   into   the   xxunk   up   lives   of   a   few   xxunk   -   and   that &#39; s   xxunk   xxunk   even   as   an   afternoon   waste .,xxbos   for   a   low   budget   project ,   the   film   was   a   success .   the   story   is   xxunk ,   and   the   actors   were   xxunk .   eva   xxunk ,   who   now   stars   on   the   tv   show   &#34; xxunk ,&#34;   is   xxunk   than   ever .   the   xxunk   were   ideal   for   the   xxunk   plot ,   and   the   director   shows   his   talent   by   taking   on   many   xxunk   for   his   project .   of   course   this   low   budget   film   could   use   better   editing   xxunk   and   more   special   effects   for   the   gun   scenes ,   but   the   music   xxunk   this   script   moving .   although   this   film   has   it &#39; s   share   of   problems ,   such   as   xxunk ,   i   must   say   that   i   would   rent   the   director &#39; s   next   movie .   if   your   a   film   student ,   you   could   learn   a   few   things   from   the   director &#39; s   xxunk .,xxbos   yes ,   he   is !   xxunk no ,   not   because   of   xxunk   xxunk   to   xxunk   his   actors   and   show   xxunk   their   xxunk .   xxunk   is   the   naked   &#34; emperor &#34;   -   so   to   speak xxunk

   it &#39; s   big   time   for   someone   to   state   the   truth .   this   xxunk   is   a   xxunk ,   a   xxunk   xxunk   in   an   old   man &#39; s   body .   his   xxunk   of   nude   scenes   have   no   artistic   xxunk   xxunk .   it   is   100 %   visual   xxunk :   he   gets   his   kicks   by   making   the   actors   strip   in   the   xxunk   and   look   at   their   xxunk .   and   if   he   does   this   in   front   of   the   audience ,   he   might   eve   get   a   xxunk !   did   you   know   that ,   on   the   set   of   &#34; xxunk   xxunk &#34;,   he   used   to   xxunk   poor   xxunk   xxunk ,   by   xxunk   her :   &#34; oh ,   xxunk ,   how   i   wanna   f xxunk   you xxunk   she   is   a   great   lady ,   very   xxunk   and   sensitive ,   and   she   became   xxunk   xxunk   -   to   his   petty   satisfaction !   and ,   as   a   xxunk   alarm   signal   about   the   degree   of   xxunk   and   xxunk   of   education   in   xxunk   xxunk ,   so   many   people   are   still   so   xxunk   to   xxunk   these   visual   xxunk   &#34; works   of   art &#34;!   will   anyone   have   ever   the   xxunk   to   xxunk   the   truth   of   it   all ?,xxbos   an   excellent   film   xxunk   the   cross   xxunk   in   the   lives   of   a   xxunk   mix   of   not   so   ordinary   people   in   the   rural   pacific   northwest .   solid   xxunk   and   writing   along   with   fine   acting ,   xxunk   the   performances   by   xxunk   xxunk   and   dan   xxunk .   xxunk ,   this   film   was   made   in   the   same   year   as   the   highly   successful   &#34; crash ,&#34;   written   and   directed   by   paul   xxunk .   the   pace   of   the   action   may   not   be   as   xxunk   as   that   in   urban   los   angeles ,   and   the   characters   may   xxunk   to   be   better   xxunk   with   each   other   in   &#34; apart   from   that ,&#34;   but   the   personal   relationships   of   the   characters   are   as   xxunk   and   xxunk   and   their   stories   as   xxunk   as   any   of   those   in   &#34; crash .&#34;   for   those   xxunk   who   xxunk   &#34; crash &#34;   this   is   a   must   see   film .   also ,   xxunk   of   jim   xxunk   and   john   xxunk   will   like   this   movie .
